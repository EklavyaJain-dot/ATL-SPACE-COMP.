<div style="position: relative; font-size: 30px; bottom: 25px;"><center>The definition of “habitable zone” is the distance from a star at which liquid water could exist on orbiting planets’ surfaces. Habitable zones are also known as Goldilocks’ zones, where conditions might be just right – neither too hot nor too cold – for life.</center>

    <div style="position: relative; font-size: 30px;"><center><p>When searching for possibly habitable exoplanets, it helps to start with </p>worlds similar to our own. But what does “similar” mean? Many rocky <p>planets have been detected in Earth’s size-range: a point in favor of </p>possible life. Based on what we’ve observed in our own solar system,<p> large, gaseous worlds like Jupiter seem far less likely to offer habitable</p> conditions. But most of these Earth-sized worlds have been detected <p>orbiting red-dwarf stars; Earth-sized planets in wide orbits around Sun-</p>like stars are much harder to detect.<p></p><p>And, of course, when talking about habitable exoplanets, we’re really</p> talking about their stars, the dominant force in any planetary system. <p>Habitable zones potentially capable of hosting life-bearing planets are</p> wider for hotter stars. Smaller, dimmer red dwarfs, the most common<p> type in our Milky Way galaxy, have much tighter habitable zones as in</p> the TRAPPIST-1 system. Planets in a red dwarf's comparatively narrow<p> habitable zone, which is very close to the star, are exposed to extreme </p>levels of X-ray and ultraviolet (UV) radiation, which can be up to <p>hundreds of thousands of times more intense than what Earth receives </p> from the Sun</p></center></div>
